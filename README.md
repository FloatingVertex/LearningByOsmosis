# LearningByOsmosis
A 4 person competitive brawler in which you throw books at your opponents to 
fill their heads with knowledge (until they can't take any more!) Each book 
you get hit by grants you powers based on the subject matter, but brings you 
one hit closer to exploding. Get hit by all 6 books, and you're toast!
